    DialogLine: The corridor seems to lighten up as you continue walking, despite
      no lamps or windows being present. Eventually, you reach the end only to find
      a single door. Despite being closed, you cannot shake off the feeling that
      it is in fact the source of the light present in the corridor. This door beckons
      you.
