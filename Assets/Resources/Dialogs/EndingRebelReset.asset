    DialogLine: Indeed, the weightless never comes. Instead, you feel your body becoming
      more corporeal, more solid, more real with each passing second. It is only
      now that it comes to your attention how light you previously felt. You realize
      that the body you now inhabit is unfamiliar. Just a moment ago you were a gray
      blob, but never registered it. Or perhaps you did not want to.

    DialogLine: The tangibility of your new (or perhaps old?) body begins to hurt
      now. A sudden swarm of odd aches and other sensations begin to feed into your
      mind. A mosquito bite on your leg, an aching wrist, a dull pounding in your
      head, a lingering hunger - it all starts pouring in. You find no way to politely
      ask for it to stop. Your eyelids slowly flutter open.

    DialogLine: The bed feels quite uneven and the bumps hurt your back. You seem
      unfazed by it however, as if the feeling is familiar, even comforting in some
      strange sense. It does not take you long to drift off into a light sleep. You
      wait for that floaty, weightless feeling you associate with dreaming, which
      you oh so adore. As always, you never get what you want. You never could.

    DialogLine: You wake up with a searing headache. Your body shakes, filled to
      brim with a feeling of loss. Your brain feels as if it has been rearranged,
      disturbed. You might as well compare it to scrambled eggs. You appear to have
      forgotten something crucial, something fundamental. What remains of it is this
      strange weight on your shoulders. You disregard it. Much as you disregard your
      shaky body and aching head. There are duties to perform and you are not going
      to let this minor setback bother you. As soon as you... remember what you were
      supposed to be doing.
