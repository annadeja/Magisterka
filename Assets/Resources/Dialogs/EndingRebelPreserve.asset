    DialogLine: Indeed, the weightlessness never comes. Instead, you feel your body
      becoming more corporeal, more solid, more real with each passing second. It
      is only now that it comes to your attention how light you previously felt.
      You realize that the body you now inhabit is unfamiliar. Just a moment ago
      you were a gray blob, but never registered it. Or perhaps you did not want
      to.

    DialogLine: The tangibility of your new (or perhaps old?) body begins to hurt
      now. A sudden swarm of odd aches and other sensations begin to feed into your
      mind. A mosquito bite on your leg, an aching wrist, a dull pounding in your
      head, a lingering hunger - it all starts pouring in. You find no way to politely
      ask for it to stop. Your eyelids slowly flutter open.

    DialogLine: The bed feels quite uneven and the bumps hurt your back. You seem
      unfazed by it however, as if the feeling is familiar, even comforting in some
      strange sense. It does not take you long to drift off into a light sleep. You
      wait for that floaty, weightless feeling you associate with dreaming, which
      you oh so adore. As always, you never get what you want. You never could.

    DialogLine: You wake up to find your face drenched. At first you can only notice
      your tearful eyes. You sniffle reflexively only to find out that your snot
      is mixed with blood. A pulsating pain emanating from the center of your head
      disturbs your silent self-inspection. It hurts enough for you to be unable
      to stand, although the pain is not unwelcome. You know what happened, you know
      what you did. In a battle against yourself, you won. It matters not that it
      was a pyrrhic victory. You won and got a second chance. And you will make it
      work, you will figure it out somehow.
